This repository helps me experiment with the DDD approach.

All implementations are inspired by books, ValueObject library created by [Nicol√≤ Pignatelli](https://github.com/nicolopignatelli), 
[SeedStack](http://seedstack.org) Java development stack, [ValueObjects toolkit](https://github.com/barryosull/valueobjects)
 and some other, more direct sources, but mainly by my experiences and needs.

## Should I use this library?

Although this package can be introduced as a Generic Subdomain to relieve the Core Domain of a project from unnecessary 
clutter, it has been developed as an example which probably do not reflect 100% your domain. Therefore, you should 
rather write your own DDD components using interfaces provided by the [DDD Generics](https://github.com/andrzejkupczyk/ddd-generic-subdomain) 
package to force members of your team or yourself on thinking in terms of immutable objects and their interaction.

## Installation

Using Composer:

```
composer require andrzejkupczyk/ddd-building-blocks
```

## Example usages

```php
<?php

namespace Math\Number;

use WebGarden\Model\ValueObject\Number\Integer;

class Natural extends Integer
{
    protected function assertThat($value)
    {
        return parent::assertThat($value)->greaterThan(0);
    }
}
```
